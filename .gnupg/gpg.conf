# /etc/gnupg/gpg.conf
# The /etc/gnupg/gpg.conf file is the global configuration file for GnuPG (GPG â€“ GNU Privacy Guard). It contains default options that apply to all users on the system unless overridden by a user-specific configuration file (~/.gnupg/gpg.conf).

# Key Points About /etc/gnupg/gpg.conf:
# System-wide config: Affects all users unless they have their own ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf.
# Optional: This file may not exist by default and can be created if needed.
# Permissions: It should generally be readable by all users but only writable by root.

# Usage Notes
# Location: If you're setting up policies or default behavior for all users (e.g., in a corporate environment), /etc/gnupg/gpg.conf is useful.
# User Overrides: Settings in ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf override this file.
# Compatibility: Different versions of GnuPG might support different options. Use man gpg for your version.
