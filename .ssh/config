# SSH connections automatically disconnect after being idle for a long time. This is common behavior on Linux servers and is usually caused by **idle timeout settings on either the server or the client**.

# Method 1: Configure a heartbeat on the client side (recommended)
Host *
  ServerAliveInterval 60
  ServerAliveCountMax 3
# Sends a "keep-alive" message every 60 seconds;
# Allows up to 3 missed responses before disconnecting.

# Method 2: Modify the server SSH configuration (requires root permission)
# nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# ClientAliveInterval 60
# ClientAliveCountMax 3

# Method 3: Temporary option (command line)
# ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=60 user@host
