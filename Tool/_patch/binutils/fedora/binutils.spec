#---Start of Configure Options-----------------------------------------------

# The binutils can be built with the following parameters to change
#  the default behaviour:

# --with    bootstrap    Build with minimal dependencies.
# --with    clang        Force building with CLANG instead of GCC.
# --with    crossbuilds  Build cross targeted versions of the binutils as well as natives.
# --with    debug        Build without optimizations and without splitting the debuginfo into a separate file.
# --without debuginfod   Disable support for debuginfod.
# --without docs         Skip building documentation.  Default is with docs, except when building a cross binutils.
# --without gold         Disable building of the GOLD linker.
# --without gprofng      Do not build the GprofNG profiler.
# --without systemzlib   Use the binutils version of zlib.
# --without testsuite    Do not run the testsuite.  Default is to run it.

# Other configuration options can be set by modifying the following defines.

# Create shared libraries.
%define enable_shared 1

# Create deterministic archives (ie ones without timestamps).
# Default is off because of BZ 1195883.
%define enable_deterministic_archives 0

# Generate a warning when linking creates an executable stack
%define warn_for_executable_stacks 1

# Generate a warning when linking creates a segment with read, write and execute permissions
%define warn_for_rwx_segments 1

# Turn the above warnings into errors.  Only effective if the warnings are enabled.
%define error_for_executable_stacks 0
%define error_for_rwx_segments 0

# Enable support for GCC LTO compilation.
# Disable if it is necessary to work around bugs in LTO.
%define enable_lto 1

# Enable support for generating new dtags in the linker
# Disable if it is necessary to use RPATH instead.
# Currently enabled for Fedora, disabled for RHEL.
%if 0%{?fedora} != 0
%define enable_new_dtags 1
%else

%endif

# Enable the compression of debug sections as default behaviour of the
# assembler and linker.  This option is disabled for now.  The assembler and
# linker have command line options to override the default behaviour.
%define default_compress_debug 0

# Default to read-only-relocations (relro) in shared binaries.
# This is enabled as a security feature.
%define default_relro 1

# Enable the default generation of GNU Build notes by the assembler.
# This option is disabled as it has turned out to be problematic for the i686
# architecture, although the exact reason has not been determined.  (See
# BZ 1572485).  It also breaks building EFI binaries on AArch64, as these
# cannot have relocations against absolute symbols.
%define default_generate_notes 0

# Enable thread support in the GOLD linker (if it is being built).  This is
# particularly important if plugins to the linker intend to use threads
# themselves.  See BZ 1636479 for more details.  This option is made
# configurable in case there is ever a need to disable thread support.
%define enable_threading 1

# Enable the use of separate code and data segments for all architectures,
# not just x86/x86_64.

Source: https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/binutils-%{version}.tar.xz
Source2: binutils-2.19.50.0.1-output-format.sed

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Purpose:  Use /lib64 and /usr/lib64 instead of /lib and /usr/lib in the
#           default library search path of 64-bit targets.
# Lifetime: Permanent, but it should not be.  This is a bug in the libtool
#           sources used in both binutils and gcc, (specifically the
#           libtool.m4 file).  These are based on a version released in 2009
#           (2.2.6?) rather than the latest version.  (Definitely fixed in
#           libtool version 2.4.6).
Patch01: binutils-libtool-lib64.patch

# Purpose:  Appends a RHEL or Fedora release string to the generic binutils
#           version string.
# Lifetime: Permanent.  This is a RHEL/Fedora specific patch.
Patch02: binutils-version.patch

# Purpose:  Exports the demangle.h header file (associated with the libiberty
#           sources) with the binutils-devel rpm.
# Lifetime: Permanent.  This is a RHEL/Fedora specific patch.
Patch03: binutils-export-demangle.h.patch

# Purpose:  Disables the check in the BFD library's bfd.h header file that
#           config.h has been included before the bfd.h header.  See BZ
#           #845084 for more details.
# Lifetime: Permanent - but it should not be.  The bfd.h header defines
#           various types that are dependent upon configuration options, so
#           the order of inclusion is important.
# FIXME:    It would be better if the packages using the bfd.h header were
#           fixed so that they do include the header files in the correct
#           order.
Patch04: binutils-no-config-h-check.patch

# Purpose:  Disable an x86/x86_64 optimization that moves functions from the
#           PLT into the GOTPLT for faster access.  This optimization is
#           problematic for tools that want to intercept PLT entries, such
#           as ltrace and LD_AUDIT.  See BZs 1452111 and 1333481.
# Lifetime: Permanent.  But it should not be.
# FIXME:    Replace with a configure time option.
Patch05: binutils-revert-PLT-elision.patch

# Purpose:  Do not create PLT entries for AARCH64 IFUNC symbols referenced in
#           debug sections.
# Lifetime: Permanent.
# FIXME:    Find related bug.  Decide on permanency.
Patch06: binutils-2.27-aarch64-ifunc.patch

# Purpose:  Stop the binutils from statically linking with libstdc++.
# Lifetime: Permanent.
Patch07: binutils-do-not-link-with-static-libstdc++.patch

# Purpose:  Allow OS specific sections in section groups.
# Lifetime: Fixed in 2.42 (maybe)
Patch08: binutils-special-sections-in-groups.patch

# Purpose:  Stop gold from aborting when input sections with the same name
#            have different flags.
# Lifetime: Fixed in 2.42 (maybe)
Patch09: binutils-gold-mismatched-section-flags.patch

# Purpose:  Change the gold configuration script to only warn about
#            unsupported targets.  This allows the binutils to be built with
#            BPF support enabled.
# Lifetime: Permanent.
Patch10: binutils-gold-warn-unsupported.patch

# Purpose:  Enable the creation of .note.gnu.property sections by the GOLD
#            linker for x86 binaries.
# Lifetime: Permanent.
Patch11: binutils-gold-i386-gnu-property-notes.patch

# Purpose:  Allow the binutils to be configured with any (recent) version of
#            autoconf.
# Lifetime: Fixed in 2.42 (maybe ?)
Patch12: binutils-autoconf-version.patch

# Purpose:  Stop libtool from inserting useless runpaths into binaries.
# Lifetime: Who knows.
Patch13: binutils-libtool-no-rpath.patch

%if %{enable_new_dtags}
# Purpose:  Change ld man page so that it says that --enable-new-dtags is the default.
# Lifetime: Permanent
Patch14: binutils-update-linker-manual.patch
%endif

# Purpose:  Stop an abort when using dwp to process a file with no dwo links.
# Lifetime: Fixed in 2.42 (maybe)
Patch15: binutils-gold-empty-dwp.patch

# Purpose:  Fix binutils testsuite failures.
# Lifetime: Permanent, but varies with each rebase.
Patch16: binutils-testsuite-fixes.patch

# Purpose:  Fix binutils testsuite failures for the RISCV-64 target.
# Lifetime: Permanent, but varies with each rebase.
Patch17: binutils-riscv-testsuite-fixes.patch

# Purpose:  Fix the GOLD linker's handling of 32-bit PowerPC binaries.
# Lifetime: Fixed in 2.42
Patch18: binutils-gold-powerpc.patch

# Purpose:  Fix a potential NULL pointer dereference when parsing corrupt
#            ELF symbol version information.
# Lifetime: Fixed in 2.42
Patch19: binutils-handle-corrupt-version-info.patch

# Purpose:  Add options to turn the bfd linker's warnings about executable
#            stacks and rwx segments into errors.
# Lifetime: Fixed in 2.42
Patch20: binutils-execstack-error.patch

# Purpose:  Accept and ignore R_BPF_64_NODYLD32 relocations.
# Lifetime: Fixed in 2.42
Patch21: binutils-BPF-reloc-4.patch

# Purpose:  Allow for x86_64 build environments that use a base ISA of x86-64-v3.

Patch22: binutils-x86-64-v3.patch

# Purpose:  Fix mergeing strings in really big programs.
# Lifetime: Fixed in 2.42
Patch23: binutils-big-merge.patch

%description
Binutils is a collection of binary utilities, including ar (for
creating, modifying and extracting from archives), as (a family of GNU
assemblers), gprof (for displaying call graph profile data), ld (the
GNU linker), nm (for listing symbols from object files), objcopy (for
copying and translating object files), objdump (for displaying
information from object files), ranlib (for generating an index for
the contents of an archive), readelf (for displaying detailed
information about binary files), size (for listing the section sizes
of an object or archive file), strings (for listing printable strings
from files), strip (for discarding symbols), and addr2line (for
converting addresses to file and line).

# BZ 1215242: We need touch...
Requires: coreutils

%description devel
This package contains BFD and opcodes static and dynamic libraries.

The dynamic libraries are in this package, rather than a separate
base package because they are actually linker scripts that force
the use of the static libraries.  This is because the API of the
BFD library is too unstable to be used dynamically.

The static libraries are here because they are now needed by the
dynamic libraries.

Developers starting new projects are strongly encouraged to consider
using libelf instead of BFD.

# BZ 1924068.  Since applications that use the BFD library are
# required to link against the static version, ensure that it retains
# its debug informnation.
# FIXME: Yes - this is being done twice.  I have no idea why this
# second invocation is necessary but if both are not present the
# static archives will be stripped.

This package provides the GOLD linker, which can be used as an alternative to
the default binutils linker (ld.bfd).  The GOLD is generally faster than the
BFD linker, and it supports features such as Identical Code Folding and
Incremental linking.  Unfortunately it is not as well maintained as the BFD
linker, and it may become deprecated in the future.
