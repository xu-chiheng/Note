Would it be possible to have /usr/lib64/libbfd.a in binutils
compiled with -fPIC? Otherwise, shared apps can't link against
libbfd. In binutils.spec, libiberty.a is already recreated 
with -fPIC, is there some reason the same isn't done for 
libbfd?

From binutils.spec:

 # Rebuild libiberty.a with -fPIC
  make -C libiberty clean
  make CFLAGS="-g -fPIC $RPM_OPT_FLAGS -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64" -C libiberty
