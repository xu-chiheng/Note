summary: libbfd.a not compiled with -fPIC
description: "Would it be possible to have /usr/lib64/libbfd.a in binutils\ncompiled\
    \ with -fPIC? Otherwise, shared apps can't link against\nlibbfd. In binutils.spec,\
    \ libiberty.a is already recreated \nwith -fPIC, is there some reason the same\
    \ isn't done for \nlibbfd?\n\nFrom binutils.spec:\n\n # Rebuild libiberty.a with\
    \ -fPIC\n  make -C libiberty clean\n  make CFLAGS=\"-g -fPIC $RPM_OPT_FLAGS -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64\"\
    \ -C libiberty\n"
