    \        \n * Test to exercise PIE and RELRO provided by Roland McGrath <roland@redhat.com>.\n\
    \ *                                                                          \
    \       \n * Description:                                                    \
    \                \n *   Simple test for RELRO, which happens to be a PIE too,\
    \ but that's only         \n *   because this kind of example has to be in PIC\
    \ code to make RELRO relevant, \n *   and PIE makes it simpler to write a standalone\
    \ one-file test than writing  \n *   a DSO.                                  \
    \                                      \n *                                  \
    \                                               \n *   The \"const\" makes \"\
    foo\" .rodata material, and the init to an external symbol\n *   reference makes\
    \ it require a data relocation.  Enabling -z relro for this  \n *   link puts\
    \ that .rodata into a RELRO area.  This program will crash because \n *   the\
    \ page containing \"foo\" has been made read-only when \"main\" runs.        \
    \   \n *   Without RELRO, it would let you modify \"foo\" even though it's supposed\
    \ to  \n *   be const.                                                       \
    \              \n *                                                          \
    \                       \n * Test with RELRO should fail:                    \
    \                                \n *   $ gcc -pie -fPIE -g  -Wl,-z,relro -o relro\
    \ relro.c                            \n *   $ ./relro                        \
    \                                             \n *   Segmentation fault (core\
    \ dumped)                                              \n *                  \
    \                                                               \n * Test without\
    \ RELRO should pass:                                                 \n *   $\
    \ gcc -pie -fPIE -g  -Wl,-z,norelro -o no-relro relro.c                      \
