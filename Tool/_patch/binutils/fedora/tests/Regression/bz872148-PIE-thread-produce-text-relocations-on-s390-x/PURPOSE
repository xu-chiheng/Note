Description: Test for BZ#872148 (PIE + __thread produce text relocations on s390(x))
Author: Milos Prchlik <mprchlik@redhat.com>
Bug summary: PIE + __thread produce text relocations on s390(x)
Bugzilla link: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=872148

Requires systemd without a workaround:

# PIE is broken on s390 (#868839, #872148)
%ifnarch s390 s390x
%global _hardened_build 1
%endif

^^ this is a workaround that makes bug disappear for this particular reproducer.
So, fetch systemd srpm, comment this condition out, rebuild, install, reboot, then
you can run this tests. One day I may make this part automatic but replacing systemd
wouldn't be seen as a good behaviour by other tests run after this task, so not yet.
