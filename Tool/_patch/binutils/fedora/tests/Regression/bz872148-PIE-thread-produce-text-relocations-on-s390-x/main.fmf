    Bug summary: PIE + __thread produce text relocations on s390(x)
    Bugzilla link: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=872148

    Requires systemd without a workaround:

    # PIE is broken on s390 (#868839, #872148)
    %ifnarch s390 s390x
    %global _hardened_build 1
    %endif

    ^^ this is a workaround that makes bug disappear for this particular reproducer.
    So, fetch systemd srpm, comment this condition out, rebuild, install, reboot, then
    you can run this tests. One day I may make this part automatic but replacing systemd
    wouldn't be seen as a good behaviour by other tests run after this task, so not yet.
