... stuff deleted ...

emacs is highly sensitive to the order and structure of executables
produced by the linker.  This is an artifact of its undumping mechanism
(essentially starts emacs, loads a bunch of stuff, core dumps, then
turns the core dump into a new executable).

We've seen a lot of pain around this for ppc64le as well as after the
RELRO improvements we made to binutils/ld over the last 6 months.

ISTM that the testing plans for RHEL going forward ought to include a
test build of emacs with the new binutils installed.  No further tests
are necessary since the build process for emacs exercises the
problematic bits.
