    ... stuff deleted ...

    emacs is highly sensitive to the order and structure of executables
    produced by the linker.  This is an artifact of its undumping mechanism
    (essentially starts emacs, loads a bunch of stuff, core dumps, then
    turns the core dump into a new executable).

    We've seen a lot of pain around this for ppc64le as well as after the
    RELRO improvements we made to binutils/ld over the last 6 months.

    ISTM that the testing plans for RHEL going forward ought to include a
    test build of emacs with the new binutils installed.  No further tests
    are necessary since the build process for emacs exercises the
    problematic bits.
