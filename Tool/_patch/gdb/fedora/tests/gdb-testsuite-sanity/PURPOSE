Description: gdb testing by upstream testsuite
Author: Michal Kolar <mkolar@redhat.com>

By default, testsuite is executed with default options for the package that
corresponds to the gdb command by newly created ordinary user. Before
executing, the testsuite is reduced by the appropriate reference file that
defines the allowed test range.

Executing can be modified by these variables:
  * BUILD_USER      -- user which will be used for building and testing gdb
  * PACKAGE         -- explicitly defines which rpm package should be tested
  * RUNTESTFLAGS    -- variable which will be forwarded to 'make check' command
                       and can be used to reduce the range of testing
  * TESTS_COUNT_MIN -- minimum number of cases that should be tested (does not
                       affect the triggering of testcases, it only sets the
                       value of the reference comparator)

Example:
  $ BUILD_USER=root \
    PACKAGE=gdb \
    RUNTESTFLAGS='GDB=/usr/bin/gdb gdb.base/break*.exp' \
    TESTS_COUNT_MIN=32 make run

Reference files instructions:
  * path of reference file for current package, distribution and architecture
    can be generated by:
      $ make ref_file
    or directly by:
      $ ./ref/gen.sh
