summary: gdb testing by upstream testsuite
description: |
    By default, testsuite is executed with default options for the package that
    corresponds to the gdb command by newly created ordinary user. Before
    executing, the testsuite is reduced by the appropriate reference file that
    defines the allowed test range.

    Executing can be modified by these variables:
      * BUILD_USER      -- user which will be used for building and testing gdb
      * PACKAGE         -- explicitly defines which rpm package should be tested
      * RUNTESTFLAGS    -- variable which will be forwarded to 'make check' command
                           and can be used to reduce the range of testing
      * TESTS_COUNT_MIN -- minimum number of cases that should be tested (does not
                           affect the triggering of testcases, it only sets the
                           value of the reference comparator)

    Example:
      $ BUILD_USER=root \
        PACKAGE=gdb \
        RUNTESTFLAGS='GDB=/usr/bin/gdb gdb.base/break*.exp' \
        TESTS_COUNT_MIN=32 make run

    Reference files instructions:
      * path of reference file for current package, distribution and architecture
        can be generated by:
          $ make ref_file
        or directly by:
          $ ./ref/gen.sh
